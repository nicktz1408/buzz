# BUZZ! #
Buzz is a trivia game I codeveloped with a friend as part of our university coursework. It is based on Java and it featured a Graphical User Interface.

I wrote mainly the code for the GameLogic (https://github.com/nicktz1408/buzz/tree/master/src/GameLogic) and the unit tests (almost 100% coverage).
